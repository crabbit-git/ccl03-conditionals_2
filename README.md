# What's this then?

This was part of the first module of taught coursework for a software development course I'm doing at the moment. The aim seems to have been to use flowcharts to help understand how logic can be structured in code, specifically in Python 3.


# Right... but what does it do?

It's really basic, just converting a flowchart into code, pertaining to the process of making a cup of tea. I didn't write the logic, I just wrote the code to mirror what was in the flowchart. That's it. There's no front end, just one .py file that runs in a terminal.
